## Part 2: Learning function from Tidyverse

- Function `select()` from package [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html#select-columns-with-select)). It using for select columns

```
books %>% select(Rating, Book_title, Price)
```
** You can sepearate this part or combine in part of `Transform data with dplyr and finding insight the data`

## Part 3: Transform data with dplyr and finding insight the data

1.Average of rating in each type of book

```
books %>% group_by(Type) %>% select(Type, Rating) %>% summarise(avg = mean(Rating))

```

Result:

```
  Type                    avg
  <chr>                 <dbl>
1 Boxed Set - Hardcover  4.49
2 ebook                  4.29
3 Hardcover              4.06
4 Kindle Edition         4.01
5 Paperback              4.06
6 Unknown Binding        3.99

```

2.Maximum and minimum of rating in each type of book

```
books %>% group_by(Type) %>% select(Type, Rating) %>% summarise(max = max(Rating), min = min(Rating))

```

Result:

```
  Type                    max   min
  <chr>                 <dbl> <dbl>
1 Boxed Set - Hardcover  4.49  4.49
2 ebook                  5     3.91
3 Hardcover              4.77  3.45
4 Kindle Edition         4.35  3.33
5 Paperback              4.72  3   
6 Unknown Binding        4.11  3.87

```

3.Rating that more than 4 have the average price is 4.23

```
books %>% filter(Rating > 4) %>% summarise(avg = mean(Rating))

```

Result:

```
       avg
1 4.233779

```

4.Rating and price of hardcover book that has maximum and minimum reviews

```
hardcover_book <- books %>% filter(Type == 'Hardcover')
max_review <- max(hardcover_book$Reviews)

hardcover_book %>% filter(Reviews == max_review) %>% select(Book_title, Rating, Price)

```

Result:

```
                    Book_title Rating    Price
1 The C++ Programming Language   4.08 69.37941

```

5.Average number of pages in each type of book

```
books %>% group_by(Type) %>% select(Type, Number_Of_Pages) %>% summarise(avg = mean(Number_Of_Pages))

```

Result:

```
  Type                    avg
  <chr>                 <dbl>
1 Boxed Set - Hardcover  896 
2 ebook                  386 
3 Hardcover              614.
4 Kindle Edition         283.
5 Paperback              407.
6 Unknown Binding        249 

```

6.Average of price that book has the number of pages between 300 and 400

```
books %>% filter(Number_Of_Pages > 300, Number_Of_Pages < 400) %>% summarise(avd_price = mean(Price))

```

Result:

```
  avd_price
1  40.64745

```
## Part 4: Visualization with GGplot2
### 1.) Graph show the number of books in each type
```
# Step 1: Creating a basic Bar Graph
# Save to object
books_bar<- ggplot(books,aes(x=Type)) + geom_bar()
books_bar

# Adding component
books_bar + ggtitle("Number of books in each type") +
  xlab("Type") + ylab("number of books")
  
```
Result:

![Graph 1](books_bar.png)

### 1.) Graph show relation between rating and price
```
# Step 1: Creating a scatter plot
books %>% ggplot(aes(x=Rating,y=Price))+geom_point()

# Step 2: Using filter data to expand more details
books %>% filter(Price<150) %>% ggplot(aes(x=Rating,y=Price))+geom_point()

# Step 3: Label type with color
books_scatter <- books %>% filter(Price<150) %>% ggplot(aes(x=Rating,y=Price))+geom_point()+
  geom_point(aes(color=Type))

books_scatter

# Step 4: Adding a line of best fit to a plot
books_scatter + geom_smooth() 
books_scatter + geom_smooth(method="lm") #linear model
  
```
Result:

![Graph 1](books_scatter.png)
