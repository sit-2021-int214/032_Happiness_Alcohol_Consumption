## Part 2: Learning function from Tidyverse

- Function `select()` from package [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html#select-columns-with-select). It using for select columns

```
books %>% select(Rating, Book_title, Price)
```

- Function `filter` from package [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html#filter-rows-with-filter). It using to filter the rows according to the condition that we want

```
books %>% filter(Rating > 4) %>% select(Rating, Book_title, Price)
```

- Function `arrange` from package [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html#arrange-rows-with-arrange). It using for sort rows

```
books %>% select(Rating, Book_title, Price) %>% arrange(Rating)
```

- Function `group_by` and `summarise` from package dplyr. 
  - [group_by](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html) using for takes a data frame and one or more variables to group by
  - [summarise](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html#summarise-values-with-summarise) reduces multiple values down to a single summary.

```
books %>% group_by(Type) %>% summarise(sum_reviews = sum(as.numeric(Reviews), na.rm = TRUE))
```
** `as.numeric` using for change data type to numeric

- Function `mutate` from package [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html#add-new-columns-with-mutate). It using for adds new variables that are functions of existing variablessort rows

```
books %>% mutate(Price_TH = Price*33)
```

- Function `ggplot` from package [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). It using creating various graphs
For example : bar graph

```
ggplot(books, aes(x=Type)) + geom_bar()
```

## Part 3: Transform data with dplyr and finding insight the data

6 Unknown Binding        249 

```

### 6.Average of price that book has the number of pages between 300 and 400

```
books %>% filter(Number_Of_Pages > 300, Number_Of_Pages < 400) %>% summarise(avd_price = mean(Price))

```

Result:

### 8.List book title and price of all books for beginner
- `str_subset` from package [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) using to filter only strings that matching a pattern (The pattern is "Beginner" in this case.)
- `%n%` a operation can be used to identify if an element belongs to a vector or dataframe. 

```
b <- str_subset(books$Book_title, "Beginner")
books %>% filter(Book_title %in% b) %>% select(Book_title, Price)

```

Result:

```

## Part 4: Visualization with GGplot2
### 1.) Graph show the number of books in each type
Use `scale_fill_hue` to fill the color in each bar
```
# Step 1: Creating a basic Bar Graph
# Save to object
books_bar<- ggplot(books, aes(x=Type, fill=Type )) + 
  geom_bar( ) +
  scale_fill_hue(c = 40) 

books_bar

# Adding component
books_bar + ggtitle("Number of books in each type") +
  xlab("Type") + ylab("number of books")
  
```
Result:

![Graph 1](books_bar.png)

### 1.) Graph show relation between rating and price
```
# Step 1: Creating a scatter plot
books %>% ggplot(aes(x=Rating,y=Price))+geom_point()

# Step 2: Using filter data to expand more details
books %>% filter(Price<150) %>% ggplot(aes(x=Rating,y=Price))+geom_point()

# Step 3: Label type with color
books_scatter <- books %>% filter(Price<150) %>% ggplot(aes(x=Rating,y=Price))+geom_point()+
  geom_point(aes(color=Type))

books_scatter

# Step 4: Adding a line of best fit to a plot
books_scatter + geom_smooth() 
books_scatter + geom_smooth(method="lm") #linear model
  
```
Result:
